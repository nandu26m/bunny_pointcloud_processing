# Point Cloud Processing with Open3D

This project demonstrates a full pipeline for processing and visualizing 3D point cloud data using Python and the [Open3D](http://www.open3d.org/) library. It includes loading data, cleaning noisy points, downsampling, estimating normals, segmenting planes, and reconstructing surfaces using Poisson reconstruction.

## Overview

Point cloud data represents 3D shapes or environments as a collection of points in space. Processing point clouds is essential in areas like robotics, autonomous driving, 3D reconstruction, and AR/VR.

This project uses Open3D, a powerful open-source library, to perform the following:

- Load a point cloud from a PLY file
- Visualize the point cloud
- Remove outliers to clean noise
- Downsample to reduce data size
- Estimate surface normals for geometry understanding
- Segment planar surfaces using RANSAC
- Generate a mesh surface using Poisson reconstruction
- Visualize all intermediate and final results

## Features

- **Point cloud loading:** Reads `.ply` format files.
- **Visualization:** Uses Open3D's offscreen rendering and matplotlib for inline display.
- **Noise removal:** Statistical outlier removal to clean point clouds.
- **Downsampling:** Voxel grid filtering to reduce the number of points.
- **Normal estimation:** Computes normals needed for further geometry processing.
- **Plane segmentation:** Detects planar surfaces via RANSAC.
- **Surface reconstruction:** Generates a mesh from point cloud using Poisson reconstruction.
- **Color coding:** Visual distinction of original, cleaned, and segmented points.
